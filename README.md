# Jackie-The-Happy-Pumpkin
Macewan Hackathon submission 

Meet Jackie the happy pumpkin. He's happy and shining bring,
but don't let Jackie's light go out. Collect all the candles 
too keep his inner fire shining bring
(timer needs to be implemented)

The theme for this hackathon was "Night of the living tech"
To fulfill this theme, I brough back something very near
and dear to my childhood. Flash. On Dec. 31st 2020 Adobe 
discontinued Flash, and with it, many of the flash games
that I as a child spent much time with. From websites
such as Miniclip, Candystand, Addicting games, and many
more, Flash games were the go to source of escape for any
elementery student in their school's computer lab.

Download is a .exe file, and windows defender is not happy about it
